# Git Lesson 

This lesson covers the basics of using git for version control. 

This lesson is for the first day of MSSE Bootcamp.

To make commit (or "version" or "checkpoint") of your files,
follow this procedure:

1. Make changes to your project that you'd like to keep.
2. When you have changes, tell git you're ready to commit by adding files to staging area using "git add filename"
3. Create a checkpoint ("commit") using 'git commit -m "message about what you did" '
